## Data Source
NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Data Set This Data set generated by NASA team using C-MAPSS simulator, The software is coded in the MATLAB® and Simulink® environment. for more data about how this data simulated check the referenece

Reference: A. Saxena, K. Goebel, D. Simon, and N. Eklund, Damage Propagation Modeling for Aircraft Engine Run-to-Failure Simulation, in the Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM08), Denver CO, Oct 2008.

The Data Source is Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps

## Data Description
This Data Set simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. data set divided into train and test, Train tables include time stamps (cycles) for each engine till failure, Test table include number of cycles for each engine before failure

The columns correspond to:

1) unit number
2) time, in cycles
3) operational setting 1
4) operational setting 2
5) operational setting 3
6) sensor measurement 1
7) sensor measurement 2
…
26) sensor measurement 26

## Project Objective
![alt text](https://github.com/Islam-Abd/TDI-Capstone-NASA-Dataset/blob/main/images/Picture3.png)

The objective to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for each engine in the Test Data Set. Reliably estimating remaining life could have many advantages as:

1) Cost savings 
2) Operational safety improvements
3) Schedule Maintainence 

## Project Files 
1) The Jupyter notebook (02_NASA_Turbofan_Jet_Engine_Data_Set.ipynb)
2) Python file (NASA_Turbofan_Jet_Engine_Data_Set.py)
3) Dataset Folder 
4) LICENSE File


## Study Outcomes 
The study is able to predict the RUL (Remaining useful life) for the Jet Engine with an error percentage for 3rd quartile for the data less than 10% and the 4th quartile is less than 22% as shown below

Based on the difference between the developed Model and Naive model (Average RUL)
The model able to operate more safely by predicted that 53 engine could be failed 25 cycles early than expected which is 1325 risky cycles on total 
and make money saving by predicting that 47 engine could operate 50 more cycles on average which is 2350 more cycles on total
