Data Description
This Data Set consist of four different data set simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. Each data set divided into train and test, Train tables include time stamps (cycles) for each engine till failure, Test table include number of cycles for each engine before failure

The columns correspond to:

1) unit number

2) time, in cycles

3) operational setting 1

4) operational setting 2

5) operational setting 3

6) sensor measurement 1

7) sensor measurement 2

…

26) sensor measurement 26

Project Objective
The objective to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for each engine in the Test Data Set. Reliably estimating remaining life could have many advantages as:

1) Cost savings (for example by avoiding unscheduled maintenance and by increasing equipment usage)

2) Operational safety improvements

3) Provide decision makers with information that allows them to change operational characteristics (such as load) which in turn may prolong the life of the component.

4) It also allows planners to account for upcoming maintenance and set in motion a logistics process that supports a smooth transition from faulty equipment to fully functional.
